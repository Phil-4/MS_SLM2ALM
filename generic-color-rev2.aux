B: Ridge estimator method. To minimize the number of points per measurement, this method employs two ridge scans ($p^1_i$ and $p^2_i$) and one intermediate point $p^s$. Ideally, it samples seven points to estimate all major characteristics of the DPOAE LM. C: Ridge follower method. This method strongly relies on the estimated DPOAE LM surface and is used to enhance the resolution of points along the ridge. It requires a minimum of three points per scan (the ridge point and one point on either side) and provides a prescribed overall amount of scans perpendicular to the ridge.}}{4}{}\protected@file@percent }

A situation may arise where certain points have been measured, but the model surface cannot be accessed. In such cases, an algorithm is used that systematically searches for data points in the $(L_2, L_1)$ level depending on the SNR. A: The general case of the Polygonal Search Method (PSM) splits the ROI into smaller polygons and takes the centre of mass ($p_{n+1}$, marked as cross) of the biggest polygon (gray hatched area) to be measured next. B: An expansion case of PSM is a stricter version of general case, which bases its prediction only on “accepted” points. It generates the boundary (n border), by using square regions of vicinity around “accepted” points. C: Inside the boundary, the general case of the PSM (A) is applied to find the next point to be measured.}}{5}{}\protected@file@percent }
